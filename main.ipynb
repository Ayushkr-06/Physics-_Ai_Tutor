    "1. **Problem Definition & Objective**\n",
    "Objective: To develop an AI-powered, personalized tutoring system for Class 10 CBSE Physics students that adapts to their learning pace, solves doubts in real-time, and generates custom quizzes using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: The goal is to move beyond static textbooks and one-size-fits-all classroom teaching. By leveraging Generative AI (Google Gemini) grounded in a specific curriculum (NCERT), we aim to provide instant doubt resolution and personalized study planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selected Project Track**\n",
    "Track: AI in Personalized Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clear Problem Statement**\n",
    "The Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of Personalization: Traditional classrooms cannot cater to the unique learning speed and gaps of every student.\n",
    "- Static Content: Textbooks cannot answer follow-up \"why\" and \"how\" questions or simplify complex concepts like \"Electromagnetic Induction\" for struggling students.\n",
    "- Exam Stress: Students lack tools that connect concepts to real-world examples instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-world Relevance and Motivation**\n",
    "Educational Equity: Provides high-quality personalized guidance at a fraction of the cost of private tutoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curriculum Alignment: Unlike generic chatbots (ChatGPT), this system is grounded in the specific Class 10 syllabus using RAG, preventing out-of-scope answers."
